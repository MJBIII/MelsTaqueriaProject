Hello! This is my first project via FreeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design Certification. I was tasked to create a survey form consisting of HTML and CSS. Upon completion, I decided to add some basic JavaScript that I'm currently learning as part of the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures (Beta) Certification via FreeCodeCamp. Thanks for taking the time to examine my first project: Mel's Taqueria Survey!
